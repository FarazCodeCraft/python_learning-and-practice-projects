# Create a Python class named `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers.
# Theory:
# A complex number is a number that comprises a real part and an imaginary part.
# It is typically written in the form a + bi, where 'a' is the real part,
# and 'b' is the imaginary part, and 'i' is the imaginary unit (âˆš-1).
# Operations:
# 1. Addition (+)
# 2. Subtraction (-)
# 3. Multiplication (*)
# 4. Division (/)
# 5. Comparison (==, !=)

"""
INHERITANCE IN PYTHON AND SUPER KEYWORD IN PYTHON
inheritance means taking parents properties and functionalities in real life, same concept in oops
FUNNY EXAMPLE: Let say got create a person and he became a father, so god think that why I put effort on passing prperties and method to child, so god just copy paste father qualities in child, that is inheritance
POINT: like in in real life, child take properties from parents, not parent takes form child, same concept here
SUPER() KEYWORD: super() keyword is used to access parents methods (not properties) and super key word work internally (only in inherited classes scopes)
