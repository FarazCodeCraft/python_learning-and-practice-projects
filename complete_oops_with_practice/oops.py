# Complete oops in python (object oriented programming system)
# why we use oops? Because procedural and functional programming are not more helpful in real world case so that is why we use oops
"""
Create a Python class named `ComplexNumber` to represent complex numbers.
Theory:
A complex number is a number that comprises a real part and an imaginary part.
It is typically written in the form a + bi, where 'a' is the real part,
and 'b' is the imaginary part, and 'i' is the imaginary unit (âˆš-1).
Operations:
1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Comparison (==, !=)
"""
# To make this class, I have to understand the logic or operations of real class of complex numbers that is built-in in python
# a = 1 + 2j
# print(a)
# print(type(a))
